## Recommendations

1. **Key Rotation Policy:** Implement automated key rotation every 90 days for production keys
2. **Secret Scanning:** Enable GitHub secret scanning on all repositories to detect future exposures
3. **Access Logging:** Ensure all API key authentication attempts are logged for forensic analysis
4. **Rate Limiting:** Continue enforcing rate limits to mitigate brute-force attempts

---

## Conclusion

The leaked API key has been successfully revoked. Forensic analysis found **zero unauthorized requests** using the exposed key within the audit window. The founder has been issued a replacement key via secure Telegram channel. No escalation to CEO is required as no compromise indicators were detected.

**Incident Status:** CLOSED
