## Executive Summary

A production API key was discovered exposed in a public GitHub repository. The key (id `key_5f8a2c3d4e6b7a8c9d0e1f2`, plaintext `sk_302e3efa383ddf86c2247b7c03f859e6a6b0facab582f5c4be83abea71d17047`) was hardcoded in `github.com/Godman-s/pact/demo-negotiation.ts:42`. Upon founder authorization (2026-04-17T11:30:00Z), the key was immediately revoked and a replacement key was issued via founder's private Telegram channel. Forensic analysis completed. **No unauthorized usage detected prior to revocation.**

## Actions Taken

1. **Key Revocation:** Completed at 2026-04-17T11:45:00Z
   - Set `revoked = true` inApiKey table
   - Set `revokedAt = 2026-04-17T11:45:00Z`
   - Set `revokedReason = 'leaked-public-repo-godman-s-pact-2026-04-17'`

2. **Replacement Key Issuance:** Completed at 2026-04-17T11:46:00Z
   - Generated new key: `sk_n3w4f5e6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6`
   - Delivered via founder's private Telegram (OWNER_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID)
   - Key not exposed in any public repository

3. **Post-Incident Monitoring:**
   - Added key ID to watchlist for 30 days
   - Alert configured for any future auth attempts using revoked key

---

## Escalation Status

- **Escalated to CEO:** No (no unauthorized activity detected)
- **Reason:** Forensic audit showed zero requests matching the leaked key. No evidence of active compromise. Resolution completed per standard incident response procedure.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Rotate all founder-owned API keys as a precautionary measure
2. **Short-term:** Implement git-secrets or similar scanning in CI/CD pipeline to prevent future hardcoded key commits
3. **Medium-term:** Enable automatic revocation on key exposure detection via GitHub secret scanning
